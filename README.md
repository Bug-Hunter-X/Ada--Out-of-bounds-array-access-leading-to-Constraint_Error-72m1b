This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada programs: accessing an array element with an index outside the defined range. The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to assign a value to an array element using an index that exceeds the array bounds, causing a `Constraint_Error` exception. The `bugSolution.ada` file presents a solution that incorporates a check to prevent out-of-bounds access.
